				<h3>Important Update(s)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The last day of school is May 24th for students.</li>
					<li>Because it has been a topic of conversation and a frequent question, let me express this: <b class="impt">I am currently undecided on whether I will be teaching again next year.</b> That means there is a chance I can and will return, however, it is contingent (dependent) upon certain criteria being met to ensure the success of the course in the following school year. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to make all those decisions, and as such, this is the reason I am currently undecided. However, if those decisions were to be made at my sole discretion, then I would gladly return, willfully.</li>
				</ul>
				<!--
				<div class="accContainer">
					<button class="accordion">Reasons for Indecision</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>Before accepting this position, I can say that I had nothing but enthusiasm for teaching the course. That enthusiasm wasn't diminished due to the fault of any one student or any group of students. The fault lies entirely in the way both I and the class have been treated.</p>
						<p>Maybe there was some truth to the negative things that the people said about the previous teachers who held this position. However, after what I've experienced, I'm inclined to believe the two that came before me had good reasons for leaving and seeking a better oppportunity.</p>
						<h3>The List of Issues I've Experienced</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Discriminatory remarks based on my age, gender, and appearance.</li>
							<li>Insinuations that I'm a child predator based on the previous statement.</li>
							<li>Prejudiced behavior and interactions based on those previous two statements.</li>
							<li>Denial of opportunities based on rumors and speculation surrounding the previous three statements.</li>
							<li>Lack of materials for the class (i.e. functional computers and the accompanying software).</li>
							<li>Lack of support from those in a position to assist in the successful operation of the class.</li>
							<li>Delays on all things necessary for the course.</li>
							<li>Constant criticism over things outside of my control, accompanied by no support from those who would criticize.</li>
							<li>Decisions made without my consent, wherein I would have to suffer the consequences afterward and oftentimes have to resolve the issue by my own intervention.</li>
						</ul>

				<p>Thank you to all of you who showed up and continued to persist throughout all the trials we faced this year as a class. I am always grateful for those of you who don't allow yourselves to be discouraged in the face of adversity and continue to look for the positives in each situation.</p>
				<p>Many of you are well aware of the issues that we've faced this year, as I have always been transparent with you when you've had questions. I believe you all have the potential of surpassing not just your peers but myself and our leadership, as well. There has never been a time I believed that any of you couldn't do something if you put in the effort and dedicated yourselves to overcoming the mistakes and failures that inevitably occur when learning something new. If anything, I was upset whenever you, yourselves, believed you were incapable of achieving what you wanted.</p>
				<p>Some of you have spoken with me about the reality of adult life, with questions about why things are the way they are. While I have answered those things to the best of my ability, I think it's important to keep this in mind: The hardest problem that anyone will face when seeking success is creating a plan of action that allows them to steadily improve when there is no one around to tell you what to do. When you're venturing into new territory, you have to create the path for yourself, solve the problems that arise by yourself, and reach your destination by your own perserverence. When you're able to do that, you become a leader in your field, and others are likely to walk the path you've charted, putting you out front as their guide.</p>
				<p>I say these things because I have lived it. I have been scorned by those who felt threatened by my constant growth, and at times, those same people have sought to create or become impediments along my path. All the while, they were showing me that the correct path to my success is the one without them on it. Whenever someone sought to create obstacles for my growth, an opportunity presented itself for me to improve even further. Thus, the quality of my life was also improved with it. There's a saying surrounding that, to whom I'm not sure who to attribute it to. However, it states, "<b class="impt">If it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you.</b>"</p>
				<p>Much like you all, I am nearing a new chapter in my life; one of leadership, growth, and increasing opportunities. It's my hope that, as I have inspired some of you, you all continue to do the same for myself and those that come after you.</p>

			<p>While I <i>am</i> currently creating videos for the assignments, it's safer to seek out either the written instructions or simply research what you need to know on your own time. It's better that you all learn to obtain the info through your own effort than to continually rely on others in the future.</p>
			<p>I say this out of genuine concern. Excessive dependence on other people can lead to you being manipulated by others more easily. <span style="color: var(--bgQuat); animation: colorRotate 2.5s linear infinite;">Just some friendly life advice.</span></p>
