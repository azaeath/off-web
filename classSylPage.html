                Following this model, as of 2022-08-28, all assignments given will have an indicator of what type of grade they account for. However, all students should note that the <b class="impt">sketchbook assignments will account for both homework and assessment grades</b>, resulting in being 50% of your total grade for each quarter. <s>Because there is a long time between when I first announced the requirement of the sketchbook and the first official due date for sketchbook assignments, <b class="impt">there will be no leniency</b> for anyone who doesn't have it by September 30.</s> Furthermore, as far as this class page is concerned, all week-long assignments will be referred to as the <i style="color: var(--mainText);">Main Assignment</i> in the syllabus table. All sketchbook assignments will be referred to as the <i style="color: var(--mainText);">Secondary Assignment.</i>

            <p>
                As of 11/28/2022, any grades that have been input before the Thanksgiving Break are final. If any student wants to make-up a grade from this point forward, they will have to do the original assignment <b class="impt">without assistance from me.</b> That means that you will be responsible for finding the information yourself on how to complete the assignment. There are plenty of free resources available to you all online. <b class="impt">The same way you all can use your phones to find anything not related to the work, you can use them to find instructions on the same things I'm teaching in class.</b> Remember that the two biggest skills of an artist are <b class="impt">observation</b> and <b class="impt">problem solving.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you can't complete the work the first time around, <b class="impt">when I'm basically holding your hand through the entirety of the assignment</b>, there is no point in me wasting my breath to explain it several different ways. Much of the problem of you all "not understanding" or "not being able to do" the assignment comes from lack of focus and neglecting to pay attention. The day before Thanksgiving Break began, I was given the greenlight to give you all the grade that reflects the amount and quality of work that you're doing. For many of you, that grade would be an F. What that means, is that <b class="impt">from this point forward, there will be no more second chances until I feel like everyone, <i>collectively</i>, deserves them.</b>
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Q2 Grading Rubric</h3>
            <p>
                You might notice that as easy as it is to pass, it's also very easy to fail. The requirements are not hard. You are also not being graded on the quality of the product as of this point in time. However, do note that the grading method I'm using is designed to push you all to be more responsible as we move forward. Q1 grades were given based on completion. Q2 grades are being given based on whether you're actually practicing what's instructed in order to improve your artistic ability. Q3 grades will mark the beginning of grading for quality of the assignment. Q4 will be more or less like Q3, but you will be graded based on both quality and improvement.
