It is the result of having to repeat the same things over and over that we've already talked about in the classroom.</p>
                            <p>I personally feel like I'm doing way too much and offering just as much, when ultimately, those who these videos are made for are not going to utilize them.</p>
                            <p>That being said, should anyone attempt to say they were unaware of what they had to do or how to do it, in addition to the resources that have been here for weeks, months, or however long, these will also be here to serve as a reminder that everything you need to succeed in the class is afforded to you on this page, regardless of whether or not you make use of it.</p>
