				<div id="info">
					<p>An artist from Memphis, TN, Justin, better known as Azaeath online, considers himself a "jack of all trades, master of learning." With his affinity for learning new things, he has become proficient in different forms of art and prefers to dip his hand into any artistic project related to video games and those who create/utilize them for entertainment whether it be professionally or for hobby.</p>
					<p>His work is heavily influenced by video games, women's fashion, and a love for all things practical, as he prefers nowadays to make things people can use rather than work for general display.</p>

					<!-- Original content -->
					<!-- <p>I'm a web designer from Memphis, TN with no small amount of things that interest me. I grew up drawing characters and imaginary animals just out of genuine interest. At the time, I had no idea that the driving force behind that was the fact that I really enjoy analyzing things, figuring out how they're made, and figuring out how to reconstruct them, which would ultimately lead me to learning how to code.</p>
					<p>Around the time I was 11 years old, I was really into flash games, so I ended up learning a bit of ActionScript in order to make edits to games in the hopes of figuring out how they were made. I also took the time to learn a bit of Visual Basic because I figured if I could learn to make a game, program included (I was very ambitious), I would be able to bring my own drawings to life in such a way that would entice others just as I was by the video games of the time.</p>
					<p>Eventually, my love for playing games matched my interest for drawing characters, and I thought about how I wanted to use my art to add to the culture surrounding gaming. I settled on brand design, and in particular, I started coming up with projects for Twitch streams. That is currently where I am with my work. Outside of web design, I create overlays for streams designed to match the game for which they're made without obstructing essential elements of the game HUD for the viewers.</p>
					<p>I prefer to freelance and eventually expand my reach to people through Patreon, where I plan to provide content that will enthuse those with a mind like my own, preferring to reverse engineer their way through learning and creating.</p> -->
