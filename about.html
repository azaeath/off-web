				<div id="info">
					<p>I'm a web designer from Memphis, TN with no small amount of things that interest me. I grew up drawing characters and imaginary animals just out of genuine interest. At the time, I had no idea that the driving force behind that was the fact that I really enjoy analyzing things, figuring out how they're made, and figuring out how to reconstruct them, which would ultimately lead me to learning how to code.</p>
					<p>Around the time I was 11 years old, I was really into flash games, so I ended up learning a bit of ActionScript in order to make edits to games in the hopes of figuring out how they were made. I also took the time to learn a bit of Visual Basic because I figured if I could learn to make a game, program included (I was very ambitious), I would be able to bring my own drawings to life in such a way that would entice others just as I was by the video games of the time.</p>
					<p>Eventually, my love for playing games matched my interest for drawing characters, and I thought about how I wanted to use my art to add to the culture surrounding gaming. I settled on brand design, and in particular, I started coming up with projects for Twitch streams. That is currently where I am with my work. Outside of web design, I create overlays for streams designed to match the game for which they're made without obstructing essential elements of the game HUD for the viewers.</p>
					<p>I prefer to freelance and eventually expand my reach to people through Patreon, where I plan to provide content that will enthuse those with a mind like my own, preferring to reverse engineer their way through learning and creating.</p>
