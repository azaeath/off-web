		<!-- Header is one of the most common tags on a webpage. They come in sizes of h1 to h6. The higher the number attached to that h, the smaller the header. Think 1st place to 6th place. 1st place is more valuable and, therefore, more prominent in size. -->

		<!-- There are several ways to modify in-line elements of text. The most common methods are bold, italicize, and underline, whose tags are all abbreviated to the first letter in their respective words. A more universal tag that allows for several changes to an in-line item, is the span tag, which creates an in-line block out of a word or another item. Another tag of note is the anchor tag, which links to other pages/websites. -->
